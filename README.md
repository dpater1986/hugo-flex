## Built-In Shortcodes

### Netlify Contact Form

A contact form that works with the Netlify form handling service can be inserted with the shortcode:

```
{{< contact >}}
```

A custom success page URL may be given as a parameter:

```
{{< contact "/success" >}}
```

### Soundcloud Player

A privacy-friendly Soundcloud player can be inserted with the shortcode:

```
{{< soundcloud 123456789 >}}
```

The parameter is the track ID. It can be extracted from the "embed" sharing menu on the track's webpage.


## Custom CSS and JS

This theme offers two ways to add custom CSS or JS assets, allowing minor modifications to be applied without needing to create a fork.

### Site-Wide

Custom CSS and JS files can be added to the base asset loaded by every page. To do so, their filenames can be added to the site configuration:

```yaml
params:
  css:
    - css/foo.css
    - bar.css
  js:
    - js/foo.js
    - bar.js
```

The paths are relative to the project working directory.
In this example, the file paths relative to the site root would be `assets/css/foo.css`, `assets/bar.css`, `assets/js/foo.js`, and `assets/bar.js`.


### Dynamically Embedded

Sometimes, custom CSS or JS are only needed on specific pages. This theme offers a mechanism to load assets a single time on the pages where a shortcode is used, even if the shortcode is used more than once on the same page.

To load a resource on each page where a shortcode is used, the template for this shortcode must add the resource to the `css` or `js` key of the [Scratch variable](https://gohugo.io/functions/scratch/).
For instance, a shortcode template `myshortcode.html` containing the line

```html
{{ resources.Get "myscript.js" | fingerprint | .Page.Scratch.SetInMap "js" "myscript" }}
```

will load `myscript.js` once on every page where `myshortcode` is used.

As an example, this is the template for the built-in Soundcloud shortcode:

```html
{{ resources.Get "css/soundcloud.css" | minify | fingerprint | .Page.Scratch.SetInMap "css" "soundcloud" }}
{{ resources.Get "js/soundcloud.js" | minify | fingerprint  | .Page.Scratch.SetInMap "js" "soundcloud" }}
<div class="Soundcloud" data-id="{{ .Get 0 }}"></div>
```
