## Built-In Shortcodes

### Netlify Contact Form

A contact form working with the Netlify form handling service may be inserted with the shortcode:

```
{{< contact >}}
```

A custom success page URL may be given as a parameter:

```
{{< contact "/success" >}}
```

### Soundcloud Player

A Soundcloud Player may be inserted with the shortcode:

```
{{< soundcloud 123456789 >}}
```

The parameter is a track ID that can be extracted from the "embed" sharing menu on the track page.


## Custom CSS and JS

### Site-Wide

Custom CSS and JS can be added to all the site pages at once. To do so, their filenames can be added to the site configuration:

```yaml
params:
  css:
    - css/foo.css
    - bar.css
  js:
    - js/foo.js
    - bar.js
```

The paths are relative to the project working directory.
In this example, the file paths relative to the site root would be `assets/css/foo.css`,  `assets/bar.css`,  `assets/js/foo.js`,  `assets/bar.js`.


### Dynamically Embedded

CSS and JS resources may be embedded on specific pages of the site using [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes).

To load a resource on each page where a shortcode is used, the template for this shortcode must add the resource to the `css` or `js` key of the `.Scratch` variable. For instance, a shortcode template `myshortcode.html` containing the line

```html
{{ resources.Get "myscript.js" | fingerprint | .Page.Scratch.SetInMap "js" "myscript" }}
```

will load `myscript.js` on every page where `myshortcode` is used.

As an example, this is the template for the built-in Soundcloud shortcode:

```html
{{ resources.Get "css/soundcloud.css" | minify | fingerprint | .Page.Scratch.SetInMap "css" "soundcloud" }}
{{ resources.Get "js/soundcloud.js" | minify | fingerprint  | .Page.Scratch.SetInMap "js" "soundcloud" }}
<div class="Soundcloud" data-id="{{ .Get 0 }}"></div>
```
